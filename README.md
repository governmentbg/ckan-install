This will setup CKAN 2.3 with:

- file storage enabled
- datastore extension
- datapusher extensions
- a custom theme extention

Currently, the provided setup script is for **debian machines only**. Tested on Debian 7 (Wheezy).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository in the OS temporary folder (usually `/tmp`). That guarantees all users can read it.
1. Download git submodules: `git submodule update --init`
1. Setup config. Start with template: `cp config.sh.sample config.sh` and modify the `config.sh` to your needs. Here is a [sample config that has been tested and works](https://gist.github.com/antitoxic/af38c0ba937ac47eca18)
  Whatever password you define in the config for postgres users, make sure you type the same in the installation
1. Guarantee ability to execute scripts: `chmod -R 755 ./debian;chmod -R 755 ./bash-utilities/ `
1. Run install as root: `bash debian/init.sh`. Keep an eye on the script. It prompts for user input at several times.

After install you might want to:

1. Add additional server aliases at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/$CKAN_INSTANCE_NAME`
1. Disable user registrations by running `bash disable_user_registrations.sh`
1. Create users by creating a file and a single user per line in the format: `Firstname Lastname;email.address@example.com` and running `bash batch_user_create.sh your/user/file.txt`
1. [Expore different guides](https://github.com/governmentbg/opendata/tree/master/guides)
1. If something goes wrong (for example, server error 500), read the Apache error logs - `$ tail -f /var/log/apache2/$CKAN_INSTANCE_NAME.error.log`


## Further notes

This project is developed following CKAN install guides. If something's missing in the guide, then the project might be
missing the same thing.

If using CKAN 2.2 or lower consider upgrading to CKAN 2.3 or later, because of resource_proxy:

>As resource views are rendered on the browser, if the file they are accessing is located in a different 
>domain than the one CKAN is hosted, the browser will block access to it because of the same-origin policy. For instance, 
>files hosted on www.example.com wonâ€™t be able to be accessed from the browser if CKAN is hosted on data.catalog.com.
>
>To allow view plugins access to external files you need to activate the resource_proxy plugin on your configuration file:
>
>```
>ckan.resource_proxy.max_file_size
>```
